### Project Background:
Pro-environmental behaviors depend firmly on individuals’ sustainability knowledge about what sustainability entails. Some individuals pursue sustainability as a narrow concept focusing on responsible consumption, while others might see sustainability as an all- encompassing concept, pursuing pro-environmental practices in every possible way. In some cases, individuals might assume sustainability issues to be a collective problem, hence remaining a-motivated to adopt pro-environment practices. Scientists have repetitively warned that there is a race against time to perhaps preserve what has not been damaged already in the environment and to repair what is left to be restored. Considering the urgency of environmental issues, it is imperative to devise an effective strategy to address these vast differences in sustainability knowledge.
The promotion of sustainability knowledge is increasingly drawing the attention of educators and layperson citizens. Learning about sustainability is essential in changing people’s mindsets that endanger our collective survival. Formal ecological discourse focuses on elucidating how the collective responsibilities in environmental problems. For instance, the workplace environmental training program at the Fujitsu group focuses on providing comprehensive environmental education, such as sustainable development goals, organizational zero-emission strategies, and specialized skill training.1 By contrast, informal ecological discourse often adapts a personalized discourse strategy. To illustrate, in addition to the workplace environmental training program, the Fujitsu group has also adapted experiential eco-tour to facilitate employees’ personal and direct exposure to actual ecological issues.
